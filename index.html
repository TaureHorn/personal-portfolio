                            Nordseewerke Emden GmbH (sometimes abbreviated NSWE, in English: North Sea Company) was a
                            shipbuilding company, located in the Emden Harbor of the north German city of Emden. Founded
                            in 1903, shipbuilding ended in 2010, and the company was taken over by the Schaaf Industrie
                            AG,[1] which among other products, makes components for off-shore systems.

                            The shipyard employed some 1,400 people in 2010 and was the second-largest employer in
                            Emden, following the plant of the Volkswagen automotive company. Today only few of the
                            former coworkers of the shipyard are still employed with the new owner Schaaf, which also
                            went insolvent in 2012.[citation needed]

                            Hans Grauert (8 February 1930 in Haren, Emsland, Germany – 4 September 2011) was a German
                            mathematician. He is known for major works on several complex variables, complex
                            manifolds[1] and the application of sheaf theory in this area, which influenced later work
                            in algebraic geometry.[2] Together with Reinhold Remmert he established and developed the
                            theory of complex-analytic spaces.[3] He became professor at the University of Göttingen in
                            1958, as successor to C. L. Siegel. The lineage of this chair traces back through an eminent
                            line of mathematicians: Weyl, Hilbert, Riemann, and ultimately to Gauss.[4] Until his death,
                            he was professor emeritus at Göttingen.

                            Grauert was awarded a fellowship of the Leopoldina.[5]

                            Laterna magika (Czech: Laterna magika), largely considered the world's first multimedia
                            theatre, was founded as a cultural program at the 1958 Brussels Expo.[1] It launched its
                            official activity on 9 May 1959, as an independent company of the National Theatre,
                            performing at the Adria palace in Prague. Wonderful Circus, which premiered in 1977, is the
                            most frequently performed theatre piece in Central Europe, and has remained in the
                            repertoire ever since. Laterna magika now is one of the ensembles of the National Theatre,
                            based at the New Stage of the National Theatre in Prague. Laterna magika productions blend
                            various genres, ranging from dramatic acting through affording a dominant role to dance and
                            ballet to mime and Black Theatre. All of their productions have been original works directly
                            created for the company, not ready-made pieces, which, with a few exceptions, have never
                            subsequently appeared in the repertoire of another company. The fundamental principle
                            (interaction between film projection and live dramatic action) has been gradually
                            supplemented with new technologies, for instance, digital projection or new media, including

                            The Budd Metroliner was a class of American electric multiple unit (EMU) railcar designed
                            for first-class, high-speed service between New York City and Washington, D.C. on the
                            Northeast Corridor. They were designed for operation up to 150 miles per hour (240 km/h):
                            what would have been the first high speed rail service in the Western Hemisphere. Although
                            164 mph (264 km/h) was reached during test runs, track conditions and electrical issues
                            limited top speeds to 120 mph (190 km/h) in revenue service. The single-ended units were
                            designed to be arranged in two-car sets, which were in turn coupled into four to eight-car
                            trains.

                            The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) ordered 61 Metroliner cars from the Budd Company in 1966 as
                            part of a collaboration with the federal government to improve railroad service between New
                            York, Philadelphia, and Washington. After difficulties testing the cars, PRR successor Penn
                            Central began its eponymous Metroliner service on January 16, 1969. Amtrak took over the
                            service in 1971.
